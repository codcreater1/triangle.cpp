Triangle Class
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Triangle class that provides functionalities to work with triangles, such as checking validity, determining triangle type, and calculating area.

Features
Triangle Class: Define triangles with specified side lengths.
Validation: Ensure that the provided side lengths form a valid triangle.
Triangle Type: Determine if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
Area Calculation: Calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula.
